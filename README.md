This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Scala involving the handling of negative ages within a class. The `MyClass` silently handles negative age assignments by setting the age to 0.  This could lead to unintended consequences if negative values indicate an error condition that should raise an exception. The `bugSolution.scala` provides a solution implementing exception handling.
